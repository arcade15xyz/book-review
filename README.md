# BOOKS AND REVIEW PROJECT

So whats happening here is that we are using relation one to many and using these relationship for making a **Book and Review**

## Qurerying and Associting Realted Models

### To get the book data for a specific book this is lazy loading

`$book = \App\Models\Book::find(1);`

### To get the reviews for the specific book this is lazy loading

`$reviews = $book->reviews;`
the reviews is the method provided in the Book model

### To get the book data as well as reviews for the book the reviews is the method in book model this is also lazy loading

`\App\Models\Book::with("reviews")->find(1);`

### To get the multiple data for books with now this is example of eager loading

`$books = App\Models\Book::with('reviews')->take(3)->get();`

### using "load" we can load multiple relationships for a $book

```
//this gives us the data for a book
$book = App\Models\Book::find(2);
//this load the relationships for the given $book
$book->load('reviews');
```

### How to add a new review for the $book

```php
$book = \App\Models\Book::find(1);

$review = new \App\Model\Review();

$review->review = 'This is a good book';

$review->rating = 5

$book->reviews()->save($review);

//How to get the reviews for the book
$book->reviews;
```

### Now to add a review for a book we are getting the data via form so we need to assign $fillables in the "Review Model".

```php
$book = App\Models\Book::find(1);

//What is happening here is we are creating a review for the book using associtaion / relation
$review = $book->reviews()->create(['reviews' => 'A very Good book'], 'rating' => 5);
```

### To find the book through a review

```php
$review = App\Models\Review::find(1);

$review->book;
```

what this will do is it will provide us the book for which that review is made;

### If we need to change relation of review to other book

```php
//initially the book_id = 1
$review = \App\Models\Review::find(1);

//get information on the book for review
$review->book;


$book2 = \App\Models\Book::find(2);

//save the $review form book_id=1 to book_id=2;
$book2->reviews()->save($review);

```

### How to search

```php
\App\Models\Book::where('title', 'LIKE', '%delectus%')->get();
```

## Local Query Scope

What local Query scope is that we make methods that scopes queries with some action i.e. :apple:\ instead of using the query we just use these **Local Query Scope**. This local Query scope is declare/defined in the model;
The Query Scope is declared with 'scope' as prefix and when calling it this prefix is discarded;
**_example :arrow_heading_down:_**

```php
//In Book Model

public function scopeTitle(Builder $query, string $title)
{
    return $query->where('title', 'LIKE', '%'.$title.'%');
}
```

**_How is it used_**

```php
\App\Models\Book::title('qui')->get();
```

We can use some adder parameters here like below :arrow_heading_down:

```php
\App\Models\Book::title('qui')->where('created_at', ">=", "2024-01-01")->get();
```

**_Misslinious_**
if we want to know the vanilla sql query in the terminal use :arrow_heading_down:

```php
\App\Models\Book::title('delecturs')->where('created_at', '>', '2024-01-01')->toSql();
```

## Aggregation on Relations

### Definition

Aggregation functions( like count(), sum(), avg(), min() and max() )allows us to preform mathematical calculations on related models(e.g. counting reviews for a book , averaging ratings,etc).

so It's main feature is to provide add a new category for all books that we will get with name like
:white_check_mark: withCount('reviews') :point_right: **\*review_count**
:white_check_mark: withAvg('reviews', 'rating') :point_right: **\*review_avg_rating**

### Using Count (withCount());

What this **Eloquent query** does is it retrieves all books from database along with a **count** of their related reviews.

```php
\App\Models\Book::withCount('reviews')->get();
```

:key: Here **withCount('reviews')** Add a new **reviews_count** attribute that holds the number of reviews each book has.

```php
\App\Models\Book::withCount('reviews')->latest()->limit(3)->get();
```

It does the same thing as above and **latest()->limit(3)** gives us the latest 3 books along with **reviews_count**

### Using Avg (withAvg('reviews','rating'))

What this **Eloquent query** does is it retrieves all books from database along with **avg** of their related **reviews->rating**.

üîë So what it does is for each **Book** to be get() it will add a attribute for **_withAvg('reviews','rating')_** as **reviews_avg_rating**;

**EXAMPLES**

```php
\App\Models\Book::limit(5)->withAvg('reviews','rating')->orderBy('reviews_avg_rating')->get();
```

It show the details of 5 books by **reviews_avg_rating** ascending mode

```php
\App\Models\Book:withCount('reviews')->withAvg('reviews','rating')->having('reviews_count','>=', 10)->orderBy('reviews_avg_rating','desc')->limit(10)->get();
```

It shows 10 book data according ordered by the _reviews_avg_rating_ in desc which are having _reviews_count_ greater than 10 and add _reviews_avg_rating_ and _reviews_count_.

üîë In case multiple Aggregation are done as in above example it gives us multiple attributes .

**_Misslinious_**
In case of query on Aggregation on relation we use _having_ instead of _where_ **query builder method**.

### üîë Comparing $this vs $query in Context

**$this (instance)**

üê§ Works on : A **single** model instance

üê§ Used in : Instance methods

üê§ Example : `$this->title`

üê§ When to use : Access model properties, call relations

**$query (Query Builder)**

üê§ Works on : A **query on multiple** model

üê§ Used in : Scope methods (`scopeXyz()`)

üê§ Example : `$query->having('title','laravel');`

üê§ When to use : Modify queries, apply filters

|  Category   | $this (instance)                        | $query (Query Builder)               |
| :---------: | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
|  Works on   | A **single** model instance             | A **query on multiple** model        |
|   Used in   | Instance methods                        | Scope methods (`scopeXyz()`)         |
|   Example   | `$this->title`                          | `$query->having('title','laravel');` |
| When to use | Access model properties, call relations | Modify queries, apply filters        |

üöÄ `where()` is used for direct column filtering before aggregation.

üöÄ `having()` is used for filtering aggregated results (like COUNT(), AVG()).

## Getting Books with recent reviews

### Introduction

**What did we learn**

üîë **Builder $query**

<ol>
<li>It represents the current query being built
<ul>
<li>$query modifies the query dynamically</li>
<li>This allows chaning methods like (where(), orderby(), withCount()) without overriding the original query</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It makes query scopers reusables</li>
<ul>
<li>We can apply these query scopes in any query</li>
</ul>
</ol>

```php
    public function scopePopular(Builder $query, $from = null, $to = null): Builder|QueryBuilder
    {
        return $query->withCount([
            'reviews' => fn(Builder $q) => $this->dateRangeFilter($q, $from, $to)
        ])
            ->orderBy('reviews_count', 'desc');
    }
```

This is a Query scope method in Book model for finding the most popular books in specific time periods. To find books in specific timeperiod we use dateRangeFilter which gives us all the books in that time period.

**_Kindly check the Book model to see the methods used_**x

## Controllers and Resource Controllers

So instead of using all our request handling logic as closure in our route we will organize this behaviour using **controller** class.  
Controller can group related requests handling logic in a single class.  
**Example :arrow_heading_down:**  
UserController class can manage all the request handling logic related to _users_, including _showing_, _creating_, _updating_ and _deleting_ the user.

**_How to build a controller_**

```
php artisan make:controller UserController
```

what is does is it make a controller in app\Http\Controllers\UserController which will be used in routes like following ‚§µÔ∏è

```php
    use App\Http\Controllers\UserController;
    Route::get('user/{id}', [controller: UserController::class, action: 'show'])
```

[For more knowledge on topic **CONTROLLER** click here](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/controllers#introduction)

**Resource Controller**  
This is used in common used case i.e The Controller handles **CRUD**(Create, Read, Update, Delete) requests so we use resource controller to make actions like index, create, show, store, edit, update and destroy.

**_How to create a Resource Controller_**

```
php artisan make:controller BookController --resource
```

What this does is it creates a Contoller with following functions(actions) automatically:

1. index()
1. create()
1. store()
1. show()
1. edit()
1. update()
1. destroy()

How to use this in _route_ ‚§µÔ∏è

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\BookController;
Route::resource('books', BookController::class);
```

This automatically registers all seven routes for tasks using the TaskController.  
So 'books' is the base url. And for any type of reqest(get, post, put, delete) it automatically does contorller actions, _The route names will also be automatically defined with this template {{baseurl . controller_method}}_

This is The table giving information on how the routes are choosen ‚§µÔ∏è

| HTTP Verb |        URL         | Controller Method | Purpose                             |  Route Name   |
| :-------: | :----------------: | :---------------: | ----------------------------------- | :-----------: |
|    GET    |       /books       |      index()      | Show a list of all tasks            |  books.index  |
|    GET    |   /books/create    |     create()      | Show a form to create a new task    | books.create  |
|   POST    |       /books       |      store()      | Store a newly created task          |  books.store  |
|    GET    |   /books/{book}    |      show()       | Show details of a specific task     |  books.show   |
|    GET    | /books/{book}/edit |      edit()       | Show a form to edit a specific task |  books.edit   |
| PUT/PATCH |   /books/{book}    |     update()      | Update a specific task              | books.update  |
|  DELETE   |   /books/{book}    |     destroy()     | Delete a specific task              | books.destroy |

[To know more about **Resource Controller** click here](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/controllers#resource-controllers)

**In books.index**  
We are using _Str::plural('review',$book->reviews_count)_
what it does is it generated plural or singular of value based on value and count respectively.  
i.e here if $book->reviews_count is 1 then 'review' is sent if it is more than 1 then 'reviews' renders.

```php
<div class="book-review-count">
out of  {{ $book->reviews_count }} {{ Str::plural('review', $book->reviews_count) }}
</div>
```

## Filter Books by Title - Adding the Form

so what happens here is simple in _index.blade.php_ we simply based on the searched value of **title** we find all the books with similar titles.

## Popular or Highest rated - View and Logic

### VIEW

so first well make a view in which on clicking the options style changes.

```php
<form method="GET" action="{{ route('books.index') }}" class="mb-4 flex items-center space-x-2">
    <input type="text" name="title" placeholder="Search by title" value="{{ request('title') }}" class="input h-10"/>
    <input type="hidden" name="filter" value="{{ request('filter') }}"/>
    <button type="submit" class="btn h-10">Search</button>
    <a href="{{ route('books.index') }}" class="btn h-10">Clear</a>
</form>

<div class="filter-container mb-4 flex">
    @php
        $filters = [
            '' => 'Latest' ,
            'popular_last_month' => 'Popular Last Month',
            'popular_last_6month' => 'popular Last 6 Months',
            'highest_rated_last_month' => 'Highest Rated Last Month',
            'highest_rated_last_6month' => 'Highest Rated last 6 Months'
        ];
    @endphp

    @foreach ($filters as $key => $label)
    <a href="{{ route('books.index',[ ...request()->query(), 'filter'=> $key]) }}" class="{{ request('filter') === $key || (request('filter')=== null && $key === '') ? 'filter-item-active' : 'filter-item' }}">
        {{ $label }}
    </a>
    @endforeach

</div>
```

So whats happening here let's first talk about filters these are the filters for the data namely _latest, popular last month, popular last 6 months, Highest Rated Last Months, Highest Rated Last 6 months_ these are with keys and labels.  
In for each in _anchor tag_ we provide route name, [all request Query, the key to the filter] this is so that the view for these filters is enabled whenever we view page see class too as that works for starting rendering.  
Now, lets talk about **form** we added a **hidden input** type with _name = filter_ and _value = {{ request('filter') }}_ this is done because when ever the form is submitted the view gets to default and don't show previously choosen filter now this will work. And Hidden input is not shown too just submitted as request.
